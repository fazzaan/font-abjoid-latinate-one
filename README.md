# font-abjoid-latinate-one
Font for abjad-like conscript, based on Latin glyphs. No name, just "Latin base". Nothing special, just a functional proof of concept.  

* _I have also created a [version that looks similar to Arabic](https://github.com/fazzaan/font-abjad-blocky-one)._
* Explore my Abjoid Conscript [here](https://github.com/fazzaan/abjoid-distribution).  

One use for this font is: helping people to become familiar with the script _style_, kinda like training wheels, before attempting to tackle Arabic.

This is a famous quote from a famous, fun film.  
Can you read it?
